# Automated Retail Sales Reporting System (Freelance Case Study)

A retail business required a fast, reliable, and repeatable way to analyze raw sales transaction data and identify top-performing cities for strategic decision-making.

Manual Excel-based analysis was slow, error-prone, and not scalable.

This project delivers a **fully automated Python-based reporting system** that cleans raw sales data, aggregates performance by city, and generates a **client-ready CSV report** in seconds.
